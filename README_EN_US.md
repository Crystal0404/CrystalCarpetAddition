## A message for our English-speaking friends

You may have found that the English instructions here are not very good, including the documentation because English is not my everyday language, if you want to make a better translation of this mod, please feel free to submit a PR to me : )

For some reason, the only way you can reach me is on Github, so if you have any questions, you can just open an issue!

## Why can't I find the feature I want in the game, or the feature I turned on doesn't work?

**Check the list of rules for descriptions**

CrystalCarpetAdditon will automatically disable the ability to disable conflicts with other mods to ensure that other non-conflicting features work properly.

If the feature is still in the list of rules but doesn't work, you can change something to make it work again

If it's not in your rules list, the feature won't work in your game, so it's disabled and hidden

For more information, see Crystal Carpet Additon's [Wiki](https://github.com/Crystal0404/CrystalCarpetAddition/wiki)

The wiki has information that can help you resolve conflicts
